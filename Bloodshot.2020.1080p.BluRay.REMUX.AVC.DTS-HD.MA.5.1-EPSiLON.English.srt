What are we doing out here, doc?

RST focuses on rebuilding the most important

We are explorers on a new frontier.

175
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,620
We develop everything
from exoskeletal reconstruction,

176
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,122
which makes soldiers faster and stronger,

177

to neural prosthetics,
which enhance the way they react.

Now, what the hell are those things?

189
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,264
Biomechanical constructs.

190
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,433
<i>We call them "nanites."</i>

191
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,478
<i>They intuitively enhance your biology.</i>

192

<i>Most notably, they react very quickly
to catastrophic injury,</i>

<i>rebuilding damaged tissue.</i>

So those are in my blood?

They are your blood.

196
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,247
We had some success applying them
to single organ systems.

197
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,625
We thought it was time
to try a full-body transfusion.

198
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,753
Of course, you did.

199
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,506
And just like our own bodies need calories,
the nanites need their own energy.

200
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,966
And this lab supplies that.

201
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,303
Obviously, the more effort they make,
the more energy they consume.

202
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,387
What's that glow?

203
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:43,975
That's heat being generated
by the nanites battling malignant cancer,

204
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,477
trying to save that mouse.

205
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,899
The mouse that just died?

206
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,486
Admittedly,
some of the early results were suboptimal.

207
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,613
Maybe we should fast-forward
to the optimal part.

That's you. You're the optimal part.

209

Because now we have the ability
to recharge when they're running low.

Why can't I remember anything about me?

211

Listen, when I was a boy,
I was a tennis champion.

215
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,642
And then when I was 15, I got cancer,
and they took my arm within six months.

216
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:30,105
Instead of dwelling on what I'd lost,
I chose to focus on who I could become.

217
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,235
And so now, when a soldier loses his arm,
he gets a better one.
